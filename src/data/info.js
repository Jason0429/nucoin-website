		"NUcoin has a fixed supply of 10,000,000 tokens total. No more can ever be created, as guaranteed by code.",
		"NUcoin is considered rare at 3.78x the scarcity of Bitcoin, and purer at an absolute 0.00% inflation rate. (In comparison, Bitcoin inflates at 2%, Ethereum at 4.2%, and Dogecoin at 3.8%).",
		"The upside is unlimited. Unlike traditional coins, NUcoin has a fixed supply and therefore has an unbound maximum. As the token gains popularity and circulation, it could potentially reach higher values. The moon is the limit.",
		"NUcoin leverages the latest modern technologies to enable decentralized finance.",
		"NUcoin can be used as both a store of value and a means of transaction. NUcoinâ€™s unique limited supply makes it especially ideal as a store of value with unlimited upside. NUcoin can be transferred in fractional amounts."
